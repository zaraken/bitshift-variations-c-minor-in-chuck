# bitshift-variations-c-minor-in-chuck
Bitshift Variations in C Minor by Robert Miles implemented in Chuck

Original code http://txti.es/bitshiftvariationsincminor

Youtube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqZgoNRERY8

Impulse, step & pulseOsc implemntations sound like the original.
This algorithm is not very suitable for live music generation in chuck as it produces a lot of artifacts at least on my laptop. But once recorded into a wav file, playing that file sounds just fine.

if you have chuck installed and on the path you can run ``` ./chuck bitshit_variations_c_minor_step.ck ``` to play.
